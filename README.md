In the dynamic and expanding borrowing market, accurately assessing loan default risk
and identifying distinct borrower segments are critical for ensuring lender profitability and
financial stability. This project uses loan application data to comprehensively analyze
these key risks.
The analysis is divided into two parts:

- Supervised Learning: This phase focuses on building predictive models. We train
and evaluate Random Forest and Logistic Regression to classify loans as likely to
default or not. This approach also allows for an in-depth analysis of the specific
borrower characteristics that have the most significant impact on default risk.

- Unsupervised Learning: Here, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and
k-means clustering to identify distinct borrower segments, each with its own unique
risk profile. This segmentation provides valuable insights for targeted risk manage-
ment and strategic decision-making.
